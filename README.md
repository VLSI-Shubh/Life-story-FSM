# 🌟 Life Journey FSM in Verilog

This fun Verilog project showcases a personal life journey as a finite state machine (FSM). From undergrad beginnings to industry milestones and onward to future aspirations, each state in the FSM represents a significant step in life.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a **Moore FSM** where:
- Each state represents a major phase of life.
- A single input signal `advance` takes the FSM to the next state.
- Outputs depend solely on the current state.

## 🛠️ Inputs and Outputs

### Inputs
- `clk` — Clock signal
- `reset` — Asynchronous reset signal
- `advance` — Triggers transition to the next state

### Output
- `state_out` — A 3-bit signal indicating the current life state

## 📘 FSM Design (Schematic View)

The schematic below provides a hardware-level view of the FSM. It was generated via **Vivado** and **EDA Playground** and highlights:

- State transition logic  
- Register/flip-flop placement  
- Combinational & sequential logic blocks

## 🎁 Fun Factor

This project was built purely for personal exploration and enjoyment. It combines storytelling with digital design, serving as a way to test and reinforce understanding of FSM concepts in Verilog — not to teach, but to playfully challenge oneself.
